# Recruitment Analytics Dashboard

This project automates **recruitment data analysis** by reading candidate data from Excel and generating:

**Status summaries** (Selected / Rejected / Pending)
**Pivot tables** for quick insights
**Visual dashboards** (bar charts) using Python

It reduces manual reporting time and helps HR/recruitment teams **analyze data quickly and make data-driven decisions**.

## Project Overview
Recruiters often maintain **Excel trackers** to monitor candidate statuses.  
Manually creating reports and dashboards can be time-consuming.  

This project automates the process by:

1. **Reading Excel data** of candidate information
2. **Generating a status summary**
3. **Creating a pivot table** in Excel
4. **Generating a bar chart visualization** of candidate statuses

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** → Data analysis & pivot table
- **OpenPyXL** → Read/write Excel files
- **Matplotlib** → Data visualization (bar/pie charts)
- **MS Excel** → Tracker template and output file
